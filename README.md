**Hand Controlled Mouse** is an innovative project that utilizes hand gesture recognition to create a touch-free computer interface. It employs **MediaPipe** for hand tracking and **OpenCV** for image processing, allowing users to control the cursor with their **index finger**. Clicking is performed by bringing the **index and middle fingers** close together, while scrolling is achieved by joining the **thumb and index finger**. The system adapts scrolling speed for a responsive experience, promoting accessibility and convenience. This project exemplifies the potential of gesture-based interfaces, providing a seamless way to interact with technology without physical contact.
